# IPL Match Prediction Project

This project predicts outcomes of IPL matches using machine learning and historical data. While the overall model accuracy is around 50%, it performs exceptionally well in predicting results for consistent teams like **Mumbai Indians (MI)**, **Chennai Super Kings (CSK)**, and **Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)**.  

## Key Highlights
- Consistently accurate predictions for strong and stable teams.
- Provides insights into factors influencing match outcomes.
- Demonstrates practical application of Python, Pandas, and machine learning in sports analytics.

## Skills & Tools Used
- **Python** for data processing and model building
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization
- **PowerBI** for interactive dashboards

## Note
The model is primarily trained on historical data and works best for teams with consistent performance patterns. It may not perform as well for teams with highly variable performance.
